As for realisation, you need your own interpretator Python (min 3.7) and IDE. 
I used PyCharm from GetBrains. 

As for settings, you need to start and download 

1) https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ - IDE
2) https://www.python.org/downloads/ - Python interpretator. You may install in include IDE, but this method is universally correct for different types of IDEs.

At first, you need to download this repository or clone it. 
Start Pycharm and open project.
